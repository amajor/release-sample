# Release Sample
This repository is just a sample to understand branching and releases.

## Git Flow

This video was very helpful to understand **git flow**:

### Master and Develop Branches

First, you have two primary branches, `master` and `develop`.

The `master` branch always reflects production-ready code. The _develop_ branch has any features that are ready for the next release.

![Master and Develop Branch][01]

### Feature Branches

Feature branches are added for each new feature. That is, when a developer picks up a story, they create a new branch based from the `develop` branch. This new feature branch should include the story number for clarity, like `Story-123-NewFeatureDescription`.

![Start a feature branch][02]

Once that feature is tested and approved in a pull request, it is merged into the `develop` branch.

![Merge the feature branch][03]

### Release Branches

When ready for a release, a new branch is created from the `develop` branch. It should include naming related to the release for clarity, like `Release-v1.2`.

![Start a release branch][04]

You may find a few bugs to fix while prepping for a release. It's okay to fix these on the release branch. But it's best to avoid adding any NEW features to this branch.

![Add bug fixes to the release branch][05]

When the release branch is ready, merge it into `master` and tag it with the version number. GitHub recognizes tags in branches and lets us easily create releases from them.

![Merge and tag to master][06]

Now we can also safely merge any bug fixes from the release back into the `develop` branch.

![Merge to develop][07]

At this point, we can now delete the release branch.

![Delete release branch][08]

### Hot Fix Branches

If a critical bug comes up in production, a hot fix branch should be created from the `master` branch. For clarity, it should be named something like `HotFix-DescriptionOfFix`. We can create that branch from `master` so that planned work can continue as normal from `develop`.

![Create hot fix branch][09]

Once the hot fix is ready, it should be merged into `master` and tagged with a new release number.

![Merge and tag to master][10]

We'll also want to merge the hot fix branch into `develop`.

![Merge to develop][11]

The hot fix branch can then be deleted.

![Delete hot fix branch][12]

## Repository Setup

When creating your repository, add a new `develop` branch.

Then, in GitHub, set `develop` as the default branch on the **Branch Settings** page.

![Default Branch][DefaultBranch]

This sets `develop` as the default base branch when opening pull requests for new features.

![Base Branch][BaseBranch]

Once feature pull requests have been merged, you can see the changes are now available in the develop branch.

## Creating Releases

Using your local command line tool, create a new branch from the latest version of the `develop branch`.

```
// Move to the develop branch
$ git checkout develop

// Be sure to have the latest changes
$ git pull

// Make a new release branch
$ git checkout -b Release-v1.0.0
```

If you have any minor bug fixes, it's okay to add them to the release branch.

Go ahead and push this up to GitHub once it's ready.

```
$ git push
```

Then create a pull request. **IMPORTANT:** set your base branch as `master`.

Once it's approved and merged, go back to your command line and also merge the branch into `develop`.

```
// Make sure you have the latest change for the release branch
$ git checkout Release-v1.0.0
$ git pull

// Now move to the develop branch
$ git checkout develop

// Merge the release changes to develop
$ git merge Release-v1.0.0

// Push the changes up to GitHub
$ git push
```

For some reason, even though this is a protected branch, it still seems to push.

## Adding Tags

List out all current tags this way:

```
$ git tag
```

You can add annotated tags in your command line in the following way:

```
$ git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hot Fix for README update"
```
