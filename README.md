# Release Sample
This repository is just a sample to understand branching and releases.

## Git Flow

This video was very helpful to understand **git flow**:

### Master and Develop Branches

First, you have two primary branches, `master` and `develop`.

The `master` branch always reflects production-ready code. The _develop_ branch has any features that are ready for the next release.

### Feature Branches

Feature branches are added for each new feature. That is, when a developer picks up a story, they create a new branch based from the `develop` branch. This new feature branch should include the story number for clarity, like `Story-123-NewFeatureDescription`.

![Start a feature branch][02]

Once that feature is tested and approved in a pull request, it is merged into the `develop` branch.

![Merge the feature branch][03]

### Release Branches

When ready for a release, a new branch is created from the `develop` branch. It should include naming related to the release for clarity, like `Release-v1.2`.

![Start a release branch][04]

You may find a few bugs to fix while prepping for a release. It's okay to fix these on the release branch. But it's best to avoid adding any NEW features to this branch.

![Add bug fixes to the release branch][05]

When the release branch is ready, merge it into `master` and tag it with the version number. GitHub recognizes tags in branches and lets us easily create releases from them.

Now we can also safely merge any bug fixes from the release back into the `develop` branch.

![Merge to develop][07]

At this point, we can now delete the release branch.

![Delete release branch][08]

### Hot Fix Branches

If a critical bug comes up in production, a hot fix branch should be created from the `master` branch. For clarity, it should be named something like `HotFix-DescriptionOfFix`. We can create that branch from `master` so that planned work can continue as normal from `develop`.

![Create hot fix branch][09]

Once the hot fix is ready, it should be merged into `master` and tagged with a new release number.

![Merge and tag to master][10]

We'll also want to merge the hot fix branch into `develop`.

![Merge to develop][11]

The hot fix branch can then be deleted.

![Delete hot fix branch][12]

## Repository Setup

When creating your repository, add a new `develop` branch.

Then, in GitHub, set `develop` as the default branch on the **Branch Settings** page.
